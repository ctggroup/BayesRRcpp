/**
 * Code modified by Daniel Trejo Ba√±os for allowing conditional draws from a multivariate normal (completing the square). Below the original comments and license
 *
 *
 * Multivariate Normal distribution sampling using C++11 and Eigen matrices.
 *
 * This is taken from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16361226/error-while-creating-object-from-templated-class
 * (also see http://lost-found-wandering.blogspot.fr/2011/05/sampling-from-multivariate-normal-in-c.html)
 *
 * I have been unable to contact the original author, and I've performed
 * the following modifications to the original code:
 * - removal of the dependency to Boost, in favor of straight C++11;
 * - ability to choose from Solver or Cholesky decomposition (supposedly faster);
 * - fixed Cholesky by using LLT decomposition instead of LDLT that was not yielding
 *   a correctly rotated variance
 *   (see this http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/48749/how-to-sample-from-a-multivariate-normal-given-the-pt-ldlt-p-decomposition-o )
